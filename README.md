After running the docker image with mg5_aMC (MadGraph)  and following [all the steps ](https://github.com/lawrenceleejr/DVMuReint)(including setting up and importing the required lhapdf sets):

1- Download the [UFO model directory ](https://github.com/lawrenceleejr/DVMuReint/tree/main/RPVMSSM_UFO)(using wget, curl, svn, etc...)

2- run mg5_aMC

3- `import model ./RPVMSSM_UFO/RPVMSSM_UFO/`

4-  `define q = g u c d s u~ c~ d~ s~ b t b~ t~ h01 h2 h3 h+ h-` This will be used to prevent mg5 from creating processes with quarks as mediators. We are interested in processes with the photon (a) and Z-boson (z) as mediators

5-`define p = g u c d s u~ c~ d~ s~ b b~` Our protons are multiparticles consisting of gluons, up, down, strange, charm, and bottom quarks/anti-quarks

6- `generate p p > mur- mur+ /q`

7- `display processes`

8- `output [foldername]`

9- For the time being, please edit [this](https://github.com/A-A-Abdelhamid/LLP_Sleptons_RPV_SUSY/blob/main/Cards/param_card.dat) `param_card.dat`:

The mass (in GeV) is in line 51 `2000013 4.000000e+02 # msl2 400 GeV`
The decay width is in line 758 `DECAY  2000013   6.500000e-15 `
The decay width is the beginning of the decay table:
```
DECAY  2000013   6.500000e-15
#  BR             NDA  ID1    ID2   ...
   1               2    13  -12 
```
Here mur- and mur+ (2000013 and -2000013) decay with a decay width of 6.5 E-15 GeV (proper lifetime of 0.1 ns) to two daughters: muon  (anti-muon for mur+) and anti-electron neutrino (electron neutrino for mur+)

10-
 Edit the parameters to generate smuons with mass of 500 GeV and lifetime of 0.1 ns
When you change the mass for the right-handed smuons (2000013), MadGraph expects you to make the left-handed (2000013) smuons with the same mass (even if we are not generating any left-handed smuons)
 After changing the parameters in the `param_card.dat`, put it in the folder "Cards", it will replace the one created by the program.

11- Use[ this ](https://github.com/A-A-Abdelhamid/LLP_Sleptons_RPV_SUSY/blob/main/Cards/run_card.dat) `run_card.dat` by putting it in "Cards" replacing the one generated by the program.

12-` launch`

13- `shower=Pythia8`
