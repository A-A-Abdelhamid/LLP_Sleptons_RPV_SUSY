# Generation

## Getting Started

1. Connect to LXPlus.

2. Run the input card generation script.

`python3 make_input.py`

3. Set the EOS destination for your generated data by changing the output_dir variable at the bottom of the header in [generate.sh](https://github.com/A-A-Abdelhamid/LLP_Sleptons_RPV_SUSY/tree/main/generate_events/submission/generate.sh) (located in the submission subdirectory).

4. Copy the contents of the submission subdirectory to somewhere in your AFS directory. 

5. *Optionally*, you can uncomment lines 10 and 11 of [submit.sub](https://github.com/A-A-Abdelhamid/LLP_Sleptons_RPV_SUSY/tree/main/generate_events/submission/submit.sub) (located in the submission subdirectory) and change the value of notify_user to your email address to get an email when HTCondor updates the status of your job(s). Note that you will receive 1 email per *job*, so if you are generating samples for 5 lifetimes and 5 masses, you will receive 25 emails.

6. Submit to Condor. (See [Batch Generation](https://github.com/A-A-Abdelhamid/LLP_Sleptons_RPV_SUSY/tree/main#batch-generation) below.)
## Customization

This repo is set up to process basic generation parameters in the header of the [generate.sh](https://github.com/A-A-Abdelhamid/LLP_Sleptons_RPV_SUSY/tree/main/generate_events/submission/generate.sh) file (located in the submission subdirectory). There, you will find variables for:

- the number of events per run
- a BSM model repository and the path to the model itself
- mass and lifetime range parameters (set by the .txt file generated by make_input.py)
- naming patterns for generated directories

There are two secondary customization files: 

- [param_card_default.dat](https://github.com/A-A-Abdelhamid/LLP_Sleptons_RPV_SUSY/tree/main/generate_events/submission/param_card_default.dat)
- [main42.cmnd](https://github.com/A-A-Abdelhamid/LLP_Sleptons_RPV_SUSY/tree/main/generate_events/submission/main42.cmnd)

### param_card_default.dat

This is the MadGraph input template file, in which you can customize the basic components of your your process.

Parameters that can **remain static** through the entirety of your process can be altered here. The proc_card generated by [generate.sh](https://github.com/A-A-Abdelhamid/LLP_Sleptons_RPV_SUSY/tree/main/generate_events/submission/generate.sh) replaces MadGraph's default card with this one, then sets individual parameters as described in lines 50-66 of [generate.sh](https://github.com/A-A-Abdelhamid/LLP_Sleptons_RPV_SUSY/tree/main/generate_events/submission/generate.sh#L50).

### main42.cmnd

This is the Pythia command file, used for customizing how Pythia hadronizes the data from MadGraph.

**Important note**: 
If you want to use a particular PDF set, this should be specified in line 30 by changing the value of `PDF:pSet`. Please also note that this installation of Pythia is not compatible with LHAPDF5. Only LHAPDF6 is enabled.

## Batch Generation

To generate data, navigate to the directory in AFS where you copied the contents of the submission subdirectory and submit the job description file [submit.sub](https://github.com/A-A-Abdelhamid/LLP_Sleptons_RPV_SUSY/tree/main/generate_events/submission/submit.sub) to HTCondor.

`condor_submit submit.sub`

You can check the status of your job(s) with 

`condor_q` or `condor_q -nobatch`

See the [HTCondor Manual](https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users-manual/managing-a-job.html) for more information.
