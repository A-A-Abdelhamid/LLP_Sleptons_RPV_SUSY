### Long Lived Particles (LLP) Sleptons in R-Parity Violation (RPV) Supersymmetry models
Here you can find  MadGraph5 cards, diagrams, logs, plots, and code used in the project

Code and produced plots used in valiating the events are in the [Validating Events](https://github.com/A-A-Abdelhamid/LLP_Sleptons_RPV_SUSY/tree/fd3017e571535c92c8ab90f5e677badd33dc8df4/Validating%20Events) directory.
